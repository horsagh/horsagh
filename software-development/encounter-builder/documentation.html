    <p>My first step was to work with the API and searching operation. I switched from a challenge rating range to a single input and a document input due to limitations of the API. Once I had the search function working fine, I worked on letting the user add and remove monsters from the search to the combat. This was probably the hardest part, because I wanted to make sure that the operation was as fast as possible, and written in an understandable and concise way. It took me a while to realize that all my event listeners were being discarded every time a monster was added because I was modifying the innerHTML of the entire list of monsters. <br><br>Once I had adding and removing monsters done, I worked on calculating the difficulty of the encounter. for this I referenced the dungeon masters guide for dnd 5e. the method they use is more optimized for humans than computers, so that took a bit to adapt. I would've liked to develop my own method, but that would require a lot more testing than I had time for. I decided against saving the users search result, because I figured that users will likely be searching for different monsters every time. As for the other requirements, I have 4 controls (search, Challenge rating, type, and document), My code is all error free and validates, the page is unique and visually pleasing (in my humble opinion), and fairly responsive (mobile is usable, but not all that intuitive). In addition, I got a lot more practice in javascript than I bargained for. <br><br> I did a good job. 100/100
